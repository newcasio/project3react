### Behind the scenes

This is my General Assembly Final project.  I decided to use ReactJS for the front end which in class we spend some time on, but which I was not confident using, and NodeJS for the backend which we only briefly touched on in the week leading up to the final project.  I also got a little exposure to MongoDB as well.  In hindsight, I think it was a good exercise to not only learn more about React and Node, but also how I will approach learning a new language on the run.


### Issues

Due to the short amount of time allocated to this project, I acknowledge there are plenty of issues with my application.  Given more time, I plan to continue improving the CSS, ontop of adding validation for the user signup/signin, as well as creating meaningful error handling visible to the end user. 


#### Credits

Thanks again to Luke and Linna.
